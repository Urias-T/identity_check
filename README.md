# Identity Check 🕵🏽

Identity Check is an endpoint built to facilitate KYC (Know Your Customer) processes in digital products. 

## Use Case 📝

On a digital product, the user uploads his/ her identification card, takes a live picture with their device's camera and fills out a form with their details. 
The live image, the identification card and their name is sent to this endpoint and the endpoint verifies using **image recognition** that the face in the identity card matches that
which is in the live image. After which, using **optical character recognition**, verification is made that the name passed in from the form matches that on the identity card.
